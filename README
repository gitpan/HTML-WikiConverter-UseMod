HTML::WikiConverter::UseMod version 0.50
========================================

HTML::WikiConverter::UseMod adds the UseMod dialect to
HTML::WikiConverter allowing the conversion of HTML to UseMod markup.

SYNOPSIS

Converting HTML to wiki markup is easy:

  use HTML::WikiConverter;
  my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'UseMod' );
  print $wc->html2wiki( $html );

Or from the command line:

  % html2wiki --dialect UseMod input.html > output.wiki

There's also a web interface if you're so inclined:
